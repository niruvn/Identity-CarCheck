@CompareCarDetails
Feature: Compare car details on cartaxcheck website with the output file
  As a user I want to be able to extract registration numbers from a input text file
  and get the expected car identity details from outfile
  and then for each registration number, compare the actual car details from https://cartaxcheck.co.uk website
  and highlight the mismatches

  Scenario Outline: Read the car details from both input and output files, compare car details and highlight the mismatches
    Given car registration numbers to read from <inputFile>
    And read car details for each registration number from <outputFile>
    When I open website and accept cookies
    And Search car details for each registration number with default mileage of 10000
    Then compare the results with the output file and highlight the mismatches
    Examples:
      | inputFile         | outputFile        |
      | car_input.txt     | car_output.txt    |
      | car_input_2.txt   | car_output_2.txt  |
